#summary How to compile the native sources

= Introduction =

The AndAR project contains some native C sources. This page describes how to compile those.

== Since NDK {{{r4}}} ==
 # Install the android [http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html NDK]
 # (windows only) Install [http://www.cygwin.com/ Cygwin]
 # Open the Cygwin shell or some other shell on a linux system
 # Go to the project's folder
 # Go to the NDK folder, e.g. `cd /cygdrive/c/Users/Tobi/workspace/AndAR/jni`
 # Invoke the program called ndk-build(found inside the unzipped NDK folder), e.g. `/opt/android-ndk-r4/ndk-build`
 # Refesh your project in Eclipse (right-click -> refresh)
 # If everything went smoothly your libs/armeabi folder should contain `.so` files

== Before NDK {{{r4}}} ==

 # Install the android [http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html NDK]
 # (windows only) Install [http://www.cygwin.com/ Cygwin]
 # Open the Cygwin shell or some other shell on a linux system
 # Go to the NDK folder.
   * This is where you unzipped the android NDK. 
   * e.g. you unzipped it to C:\cygwin do a `cd /android-ndk`.
 # Create a symlink from your eclipse project folder (should be called AndOpenGLCam) to the ndk apps folder, e.g. `ln -s /cygdrive/c/Users/Tobi/workspace/AndAR/ apps/AndAR` (adapt the path)
 # In the root of the NDK folder run `make APP=AndOpenGLCam`
 # Refesh your project in Eclipse (right-click -> refresh)
 # If everything went smoothly your libs/armeabi folder should contain `.so` files
